# Context: Locutus vs. Picard
Locutus of Borg is the Borg designation for Jean-Luc Picard after assimilation. As Locutus, Picard speaks for the Borg Collective, using plural pronouns ("we"), expressing the Borg's philosophy of assimilation, inevitability, and lack of individuality or emotion. Locutus's lines are authoritative, emotionless, and focused on assimilation. In contrast, Picard's point of view is individual, emotional, moral, and humanâ€”using "I" and expressing personal conviction, doubt, or reflection. Use this distinction to determine the point of view for each line. (See: https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Locutus_of_Borg)
